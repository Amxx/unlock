It is no secret that the Ethereum main chain's blocks have been trusted by DeFi. Over the last few months, it became clear that purchasing memberships would often not be economically viable, with gas fees costing up to $10 per transaction.

This lead us down the path of exploring our options. We are still deeply __convinced that the Ethereum ecosystem is the right place to build Unlock__. Its developer community, the multitude of tools, its track record, and, most importantly the culture that it embodies are all assets that no other "layer 1" has been able to even replicate.

We then decided to explore so called "layer 2" and found many options that we believe Unlock will leverage in the near future.

The first one is [xDAI](https://www.xdaichain.com/). This is an blockchain which leverages Proof-of-Stake (much more eco-friendly!), uses a stable coin as its "core" currency and has very low gas fees (it [costs about $0.000203 to purchase a membership](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tx/0xcc0d93a59b85009a461a064542b8cb2e55be1dba525855c3b87418d02942951c/token-transfers)!) As of today, we're very excited to see you deploy locks using our front-end, and add the locks to your blogs and websites! Just make sure to point your wallet like [MetaMask to the xDAI network](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup), and transfer some of your DAI from the main Ethereum network. Everything else just works out-of-the-box!

Over the next few weeks, we will also add xUDT, the xDAI equivalent of our [Unlock Tokens](https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/unlock-tokens-launched), as well as add support for credit cards and more! If you have deployed a lock on xDAI, please message us on Telegram for a surprise!

Finally, we will also start exploring deploying Unlock on other chains such as [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) or [BSC](https://bnbsmartchain.com/) as prompted by some of our early adopters, as well as explore [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) and [Arbitrum](https://offchainlabs.com/)!
